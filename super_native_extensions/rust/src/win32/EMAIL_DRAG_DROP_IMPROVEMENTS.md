# Email Drag & Drop Memory Safety Improvements

## Issue Summary
Email drag & drop operations were failing because:
1. `GlobalLock()` returned null pointers when accessing virtual file content
2. File descriptors had empty or missing filenames 
3. Files were created with 0 bytes due to failed content retrieval
4. Some email clients provide `CFSTR_FILECONTENTS` without proper `CFSTR_FILEDESCRIPTOR`

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem occurs because email clients (like Outlook) provide virtual files through `CFSTR_FILECONTENTS` format, but the global memory handles they provide may be:
- Invalid or locked by the source application
- Require specific TYMED handling (IStream vs HGlobal)
- Have delayed rendering that requires different access patterns
- Missing proper file descriptors entirely

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Global Memory Safety (`common.rs`)
- Added validation for invalid HGLOBAL handles
- Check `GlobalSize()` before attempting `GlobalLock()`
- Better error messaging to identify memory access issues
- Added debug logging for successful memory operations

### 2. Improved TYMED Fallback Logic (`reader.rs`)
**`medium_for_virtual_file()`**: Now tries multiple TYMED combinations in order:
1. `TYMED_ISTREAM` (preferred for virtual files)
2. `TYMED_HGLOBAL` (fallback)  
3. `TYMED_ISTREAM | TYMED_HGLOBAL` (final attempt)

### 3. Better Filename Handling
**`extract_file_descriptors()`**: 
- Detects empty/corrupted filenames from email clients
- Generates fallback filenames: `email_attachment_{index}.tmp`
- Added debug logging for extracted file descriptors

### 4. Enhanced Error Recovery & Virtual File Detection
**`with_file_descriptors()`**:
- When descriptor reading fails, creates fallback descriptor
- **NEW**: Detects `CFSTR_FILECONTENTS` without `CFSTR_FILEDESCRIPTOR` (email client pattern)
- Creates fallback descriptors for orphaned file content
- Enhanced logging for debugging email client issues

**`get_suggested_name_for_item()`**:
- **NEW**: Added comprehensive debug logging for filename resolution
- Better error reporting when no filename can be determined
- Fallback chain: virtual descriptor → hdrop → null with warnings

**`data_object_formats_raw()`**:
- **NEW**: Added detailed logging of available formats
- Shows both raw and filtered format lists for debugging
- Helps identify missing or unexpected formats

**`item_count()`**:
- **NEW**: Added logging for item detection logic
- Shows descriptor vs hdrop counts for debugging

**`get_formats_for_item_sync()`**:
- **NEW**: Added detailed format resolution logging
- Shows virtual file descriptor discovery process
- Better debugging for format priority handling

### 5. Enhanced Stream Creation & File Writing
**`stream_from_medium()`**:
- Better error messages distinguishing between TYMED types
- Enhanced logging for debugging stream creation
- More specific error messages for troubleshooting

**`do_copy_virtual_file()`**:
- Creates empty files as fallback when content can't be read
- This ensures users see the dropped file (even if empty) rather than complete failure
- Enhanced logging for debugging file writing issues

### 6. Comprehensive Debugging Infrastructure
- Added logging at all critical decision points
- Format detection and conversion logging
- Virtual file descriptor lifecycle tracking
- Memory access failure diagnostics
- Fallback mechanism activation logging

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Format Detection**: Enhanced logging will show exactly what formats are available
2. **Virtual File Discovery**: Will detect email attachments even without proper descriptors
3. **Filename Issues**: Files will have fallback names like `email_attachment_0.tmp` instead of null
4. **Content Retrieval**: Multiple TYMED methods attempted automatically with detailed logging
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Empty files created when content can't be retrieved (better than no file)
6. **Diagnostic Clarity**: Comprehensive logging helps identify specific issues with different email clients

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.)
2. Try dragging different attachment types (.pdf, .docx, .png, etc.)
3. Monitor logs for new debug messages to understand data access patterns
4. Verify that files are created with proper names (even if content fails)
5. Check for fallback descriptor creation when proper descriptors are missing

## Debugging Guide

The enhanced logging will show:
- **Format Detection**: `"Extracted X raw formats from data object"`, `"Filtered to X compatible formats"`
- **Virtual File Discovery**: `"Found virtual file descriptor for item X"` or `"No virtual file descriptor found"`
- **Fallback Activation**: `"Found CFSTR_FILECONTENTS without descriptors - creating fallback descriptor"`
- **Memory Issues**: `"GlobalLock returned null pointer for HGLOBAL with size X"`
- **TYMED Attempts**: `"Attempting to get virtual file content with TYMED X (attempt Y)"`

## Future Enhancements

If issues persist, consider:
1. Implementing delayed data rendering for email attachments
2. Adding retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. Supporting additional TYMED formats specific to email clients
4. Implementing asynchronous content retrieval for locked data
5. Adding format-specific content detection heuristics

The fixes maintain backward compatibility while providing robust fallback mechanisms specifically designed for problematic drag sources like email clients that don't follow standard virtual file protocols.
