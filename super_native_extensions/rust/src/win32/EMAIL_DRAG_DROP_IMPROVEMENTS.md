# Email Drag & Drop Memory Safety Improvements

## Issue Summary
Email drag & drop operations were failing because:
1. `GlobalLock()` returned null pointers when accessing virtual file content
2. File descriptors had empty or missing filenames
3. Files were created with 0 bytes due to failed content retrieval

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem occurs because email clients (like Outlook) provide virtual files through `CFSTR_FILECONTENTS` format, but the global memory handles they provide may be:
- Invalid or locked by the source application
- Require specific TYMED handling (IStream vs HGlobal)
- Have delayed rendering that requires different access patterns

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Global Memory Safety (`common.rs`)
- Added validation for invalid HGLOBAL handles
- Check `GlobalSize()` before attempting `GlobalLock()`
- Better error messaging to identify memory access issues
- Added debug logging for successful memory operations

### 2. Improved TYMED Fallback Logic (`reader.rs`)
**`medium_for_virtual_file()`**: Now tries multiple TYMED combinations in order:
1. `TYMED_ISTREAM` (preferred for virtual files)
2. `TYMED_HGLOBAL` (fallback)  
3. `TYMED_ISTREAM | TYMED_HGLOBAL` (final attempt)

### 3. Better Filename Handling
**`extract_file_descriptors()`**: 
- Detects empty/corrupted filenames from email clients
- Generates fallback filenames: `email_attachment_{index}.tmp`
- Added debug logging for extracted file descriptors

### 4. Enhanced Error Recovery
**`with_file_descriptors()`**:
- When descriptor reading fails, creates fallback descriptor
- Enables content retrieval attempts even when descriptor is corrupted
- Better logging for debugging email client issues

**`do_copy_virtual_file()`**:
- Creates empty files as fallback when content can't be read
- This ensures users see the dropped file (even if empty) rather than complete failure
- Enhanced logging for debugging file writing issues

### 5. Improved Stream Creation
**`stream_from_medium()`**:
- Better error messages distinguishing between TYMED types
- Enhanced logging for debugging stream creation
- More specific error messages for troubleshooting

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Filename Issues**: Files will now have fallback names like `email_attachment_0.tmp` instead of null
2. **Content Retrieval**: Multiple TYMED methods will be attempted automatically
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Empty files will be created when content can't be retrieved (better than no file)
4. **Better Diagnostics**: Enhanced logging will help identify specific issues with different email clients

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.)
2. Try dragging different attachment types (.pdf, .docx, .png, etc.)
3. Monitor logs for new debug messages to understand data access patterns
4. Verify that files are created with proper names (even if content fails)

## Future Enhancements

If issues persist, consider:
1. Implementing delayed data rendering for email attachments
2. Adding retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. Supporting additional TYMED formats specific to email clients
4. Implementing asynchronous content retrieval for locked data

The fixes maintain backward compatibility while providing robust fallback mechanisms for problematic drag sources like email clients.
