# Compilation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

The Windows precompilation was failing due to incorrect usage of STGMEDIUM structure fields and ReleaseStgMedium function calls.

## Changes Made

### 1. STGMEDIUM Field Access
**Issue**: Using `medium.Anonymous.hGlobal` which doesn't exist in the current Windows crate version.
**Fix**: Changed to `medium.u.hGlobal` which is the correct field access.

**Locations Fixed:**
- Line ~238: `generate_png()` method - CF_DIBV5 format handling
- Line ~262: `generate_png()` method - CF_DIB format handling  
- Line ~338: `get_format()` method - General format data retrieval
- Line ~355: `get_format()` method - GlobalUnlock call
- Line ~411: `with_hdrop()` method - CF_HDROP format handling
- Line ~461: `with_virtual_files()` method - File descriptor handling

### 2. ReleaseStgMedium Function Calls
**Issue**: Passing `&medium` (immutable reference) to `ReleaseStgMedium` which expects `*mut STGMEDIUM`.
**Fix**: Changed to `&mut medium as *mut STGMEDIUM` and made medium mutable with `mut` keyword.

**Pattern Applied:**
```rust
// Before
Some(medium) => {
    // ... use medium ...
    ReleaseStgMedium(&medium);
}

// After  
Some(mut medium) => {
    // ... use medium ...
    ReleaseStgMedium(&mut medium as *mut STGMEDIUM);
}
```

### 3. Unused Import Warning
**Issue**: Unused import warning for `windows::Win32::System::Com::STGMEDIUM` in common.rs
**Fix**: Removed the scoped import since the type is already used with full path in function signature.

## Verification

- ✅ `cargo check` passes without errors
- ✅ `cargo build --release` completes successfully  
- ✅ All DV_E_FORMATETC error handling logic remains intact
- ✅ Safe wrapper functions continue to work as designed

## Impact

These fixes ensure that:
1. Windows binary precompilation will succeed
2. The DV_E_FORMATETC error handling improvements are preserved
3. All drag-and-drop functionality continues to work on Windows
4. Memory management is handled correctly with proper STGMEDIUM cleanup

The core functionality and error handling logic introduced in the previous fixes remain unchanged - only the API usage was corrected to match the current Windows crate version.
